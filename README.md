# Retail-Sales-Performance-Dashboard-Analyzing-Profitability-Across-Segments-and-Categories

### 🧭 Business Problem

Retail stores often struggle to understand sales performance across different regions, customer segments, and product categories. Without a clear visual summary, it’s difficult to:

- Identify top-performing products and categories.

- Detect seasonal sales trends.

- Analyze regional performance and customer profitability.

- Make data-driven decisions on marketing and inventory planning.

The goal of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance to help business managers track revenue, profit, and efficiency over time.

### 🎯 Project Objective

To build an interactive Excel dashboard that:

- Visualizes total sales, profits, and profit margins.

- Allows dynamic filtering by year, region, and customer segment.

- Identifies top-performing sub-categories and sales trends.

- Helps stakeholders make data-informed decisions on growth and strategy.

### 📊 Key Metrics Displayed
